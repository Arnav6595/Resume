# 4. Activate virtual environment before installing:

#    use pip-tools or poetry for more complex dependency resolution.

# 6. Python version requirement: Python 3.12 (based on wheel compatibility in logs)

# 7. Any system-level libraries needed for lxml, cffi, or cryptography
#    might require installation via OS package manager if errors occur.
